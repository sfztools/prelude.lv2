# prelude.lv2

`prelude.lv2` is a simple wavetable-based church organ as an LV2 plugin, similar to [toccata.lv2](https://github.com/sfztools/toccata.lv2) but with only 2 controls akin to crescendo pedals for flues and reeds.
**Still very much a work in progress**.

To do -- jointly with [toccata.lv2](https://github.com/sfztools/toccata.lv2):
- Add some simple reverb to sfizz and integrate a slider here so it sound better standalone
- Work on the wavetables: better management of attack, randomization, panning, etc...

You need to have `libsfizz` and its headers installed to build the plugin.
